HexBright Demo Code 
=======================

hexbright_demo_morse
--------------------
Flashes out a message in morse code every time you press the button.  Nothing 
else.  The message and speed are easy to change- you can see and change both 
in the first lines of code.

hexbright4_nooverheat
---------------------
Just like hexbright4, except it won't shut itself down for overheating.  
After programming it to your light, click the Serial Monitor button in the 
Arduino software- you should see status messages and periodic temperature 
readings from the light.


hexbright_demo_momentary
------------------------  
Light turns on only while the button is being held down.  That's it.

hexbright_demo_dazzle
---------------------
While the button is down, does the 'dazzle' (puke) flashes.

hexbright_demo_fades
--------------------  
Hold the button down, and light fades up and down.  Let go, and it holds the 
current brightness.  Another press to turn off.
